# Best Approach for You
# Use slicing ([::-1]) as your default method in real-world projects because it’s:

More efficient.
Cleaner to write and maintain.
However, don’t stop exploring your logic-based solutions:

They are vital when dealing with more complex algorithms where slicing isn't applicable (e.g., multidimensional arrays, custom traversal logic).
Practicing these builds problem-solving skills, which are critical for roles in cybersecurity, especially in fields like malware analysis and penetration testing.
